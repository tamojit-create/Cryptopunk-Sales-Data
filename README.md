Total Sales:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sales FROM cryptopunks_sales;


Top 5 Expensive Transactions:

SELECT nft_name, eth_price, usd_price, date
FROM cryptopunks_sales
ORDER BY usd_price DESC
LIMIT 5;


Moving Average (Last 50 Transactions):

SELECT transaction_hash AS event,
       usd_price,
       AVG(usd_price) OVER (ORDER BY date, time ROWS BETWEEN 49 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg_usd
FROM cryptopunks_sales;


Estimated Average Value (Outlier Removal):

-- Part A: Daily average prices
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE daily_avg AS
SELECT date, usd_price,
       AVG(usd_price) OVER (PARTITION BY date) AS daily_avg_price
FROM cryptopunks_sales;

-- Part B: Filter outliers and compute representative value
SELECT date, AVG(usd_price) AS estimated_daily_avg
FROM daily_avg
WHERE usd_price >= 0.1 * daily_avg_price
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date;


nft that sold the most on each year-month combination :

create temporary table monthly_sale as
(select name , date_format(event_date, '%Y-%m')as y_m,count(*) as sales_count ,max(usd_price) as  max_price from cryptopunk_sales group by name, y_m);
create temporary table ranked_sale as
select name ,y_m,max_price,sales_count ,dense_rank()over(partition by y_m order by sales_count desc) as rn from monthly_sale;

select y_m , name , sales_count, max_price from ranked_sale
where rn = 1
order by y_m asc;

ðŸ’¡ Insights

$22B+ spent on NFTs globally in 2021; CryptoPunks contributed a significant portion.

NFT prices show extreme volatility, with large outliers.

Wallet activity can be traced precisely, since all transactions are on the blockchain.

Mondays & Tuesdays showed fewer sales, while weekends had spikes.

Estimated average price (after filtering outliers) gives a more realistic view of NFT market trends.
